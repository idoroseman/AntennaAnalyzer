# Antenna Analyzer

The antenna analyzer will provide VSWR measurements for any antenna from 1 to 30 MHz. 
Frequency and VSWR are shown as a graph on the graphical display, as well as the minimum 
VSWR value and frequency.
The analyzer can be programmed to scan any sub band and has built in ranges for 160m, 80m, 60m, 40m, 30m, 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m, 10m.
